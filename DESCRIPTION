Title: Modeling a Detector Response to Scattering of (Multi-layer) Spherical Particles
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Wade Rogers
Maintainer: Wade Rogers <wade.rogers@spcytomics.com>
Description: flowMie models the response of a scattering detector in a flow
    cytometer to the presence of a single, spherical particle with one or more layers
    described by a refractive index and a radius.
    Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are typically described by a lumen surrounded
    by a membrane, each of which can have different refractive indices (generally the
    membrane has a higher RI than the lumen).
